🐶 DogBreeds-iOS

DogBreeds-iOS is a simple SwiftUI app that displays a list of dog breeds using data from the Dog CEO API. Users can browse breeds, search by name, and view details including images and sub-breeds in a modal presentation.

📦 Project Structure
	•	Models/: Codable structs for API decoding (Breed, BreedsResponse, etc.)
	•	Networking/: API service and protocol abstraction (BreedsAPIService, BreedAPIProtocol)
	•	ViewModels/: SwiftUI-compatible logic for state management (BreedListViewModel, BreedDetailViewModel)
	•	Views/: All SwiftUI components and screens
	•	Mocks/: Static mock data and mock services for previews
	•	DogBreeds-iOSTests/: Unit tests for view models using a mock API service

🧱 Architecture

The app follows the MVVM pattern with a clear separation between data, logic, and UI. Dependency injection is used to facilitate testing and previews.
